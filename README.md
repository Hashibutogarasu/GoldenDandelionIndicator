# Golden Dandelion Indicator

This is a client-side mod that makes it easier to see the state of "Golden Dandelions" (added in recent snapshots) when given to baby mobs.

- **Client-side only**: Does not make any changes to the server.
- **Server-agnostic**: Can be used even if the mod is not installed on the server.
